            NOTE: we are doing an inner for loop to preserve the order (from most recently seen to oldest one), as search.results, out of the box,
                  will order by title, which is not really desirable. As the number of recently viewed products is kept small, I think the inner loop
                  should not cause too much performance issue (and is likely faster than fetching using all_products)
